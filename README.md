# Time Machine

In these times of great peril, we've realised to cherish the memories of the past and face the future with hope. With our app we aim to present you with some memories we reminisce over the most and a future where all is not lost, it is just a bad dream that will pass!

Come, hop on our Time Machine, a gateway to the past and the future. 

A nostalgic quiz that will take you back when we were kids dreaming about cars and technology which appeared to be nothing but magic.  
An interactive experience that would take you to a cyberpunk future.
